# Riverscapes Analysis and Explorer AddIn

This repository contains the source code for the Riverscapes Analysis Vewier and Explorer (RAVE) AddIn software. The code is written in C# using Visual Studio 2015 and consists of several code projects within a single solution:

* RAVE Visual Studio 2015 Solution
    * NARU - [North Arrow Research Utilities](https://github.com/NorthArrowResearch/naru)

* Visual Studio 2013 Isolated Shell. (Note this is 2013, not 2012, even though the error you get when this isn't installed refers to Visual Studio 2012. Also note that it's the isolated shell, not the integrated one.) You should be able to find this install from a simple Google search.
