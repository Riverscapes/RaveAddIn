As the name suggests, webViewer works in any modern web browser and doesn't need to be installed. You get to webViewer by click on the globe icon nest to projects in the [Riverscapes Data Warehouse](https://data.riverscapes.net).

Most modern web browsers should work. Chromium based browsers such as Chrome, Brave and Edge are recommended. Internet Explorer is not supported.
