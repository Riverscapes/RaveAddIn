## Updating Resources 

You will want to update resources just about every time you use the Riverscapes Viewer (including on a new install) to make sure you have the latest [symbology](/technical-reference/symbology) and [business logic](/technical-reference/business-logic). To do this, you simply go to the Riverscapes Viewer toolbar and click the update (circular arrow) button. This then downloads the latest files from the [RiverscapesXML repo](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RiverscapesXML) and places them in a local resource folder. You can browse to that resource folder from the toolbar by choosing `Help â†’ Find Resources Folder`.
