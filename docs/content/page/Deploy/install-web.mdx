As the name suggests, the Riverscapes Viewer for the web works in any modern  browser and doesn't need to be installed. You access the viewer by click on the globe icon next to projects in the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net).

Most modern web browsers should work. Chromium based browsers such as Chrome, Brave and Edge are recommended. Internet Explorer is not supported.
