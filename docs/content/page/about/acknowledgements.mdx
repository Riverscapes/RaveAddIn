The Riverscapes Viewer is brought to you for free by the [Riverscapes Consortium](http://riverscapes.net). It is how you visualize and explore _any_  [Riverscapes Project](https://developer.riverscapes.net/dev-tools/#projects) found in the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net).

## Developers

[North Arrow Research](https://northarrowresearch.com) developed the Riverscapes Viewer suite of tools. For a complete list of developers and their contributions, see Github [ArcViewer](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RaveAddIn/graphs/contributors) and [QViewer](https://github.com/Riverscapes/QRAVEPlugin/graphs/contributors) repositories.

## Project Curators

Part of what makes the Viewer useful is that layers are added to the map using consistent, meaningful symbology that has been carefully developed by the [Riverscapes Project Curators Team](github.com/orgs/Riverscapes/teams/riverscape-project-curators/members) based largely in the [Utah State University River Assessment and Monitoring Lab](http://etal.joewheaton.org).

For a complete list of curators and developers and their contributions, see Github [RiverscapesXML Repository](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RiverscapesXML/graphs/contributors).

## Funding

Riverscapes Viewer development has been funded primarily by the [Bureau of Land Management](https://www.blm.gov/montana-dakotas) and [Anabranch Solutions](http://anabranchsolutions.com). BLM has supproted the development of ArcViewer & WebViewer. This support has been through co-operative agreements between BLM and Utah State University, with subawards to North Arrow Research. 

[Anabranch Solutions](http://anabranchsolutions.com) funded the development of QViewer, providing a completely free, open-source GIS alternative to access the Viewer from within [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/).
