description: Background information about the Riverscapes Viewer
---

The Riverscapes Viewer is part of the [Riverscapes Consortium's](http://riverscapes.net) much larger family of [tools](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/) for analyzing riverscapes. The Viewer itself does not do any analysis, but allows exploring of any [Riverscapes project](https://riverscapes.github.io/riverscapes-website/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/). It is both i) a geospatial data explorer in which you can navigate the "project tree" of GIS data within a project, and add layers to map symbolized appropriately; as well as a ii) data exporer..


One of the real advantages of having [riverscapes projects](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/), is the ability to share that data with others and for everyone to see the same data symbolized the same way.
