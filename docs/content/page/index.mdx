The Riverscapes Viewer helps you easily explore maps of riverscape projects. It speeds up the process of adding data related to riverscapes into your preferred GIS with meaningful layer order and symbology.

There are three versions of the Riverscapes Viewer that all work essentially the same way. You start with a [riverscapes project](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/) that contains a collection of data layers related to rivers. You open the project in the Viewer project explorer that shows all the layers, displayed with meaningful names and icons. Clicking on a layer adds it to the current map in a carefulluy designed order with predefined symbology tailored to the layer in question.

There are three separate versions of the Riverscapes Viewer depending on which GIS platform that you prefer:
