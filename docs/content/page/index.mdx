The **Viewers** are designed to work with [riverscapes projects](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/), which contain specific collections of data related to riverscapes. You can discover riverscape projects from the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net). You open any riverscapes project in the Viewer and a project explorer exposes curated project contents.

Most riverscape project types include primarily GIS data, displayed with meaningful names and icons and the curated symbology. However, the viewer also exposes non-GIS data, like reports, json, tabular data, xml, imagery, PDFs, databases and more. Clicking on a geopspatial layer adds it to the current map in a carefulluy designed order with predefined symbology tailored to the layer in question.
