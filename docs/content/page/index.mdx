Our **Riverscapes Viewers** make it easy to explore _riverscape projects_ as maps. Developed by the [Riverscapes Consoritum](https://riverscapes.net), these tools are available as both a [web application](software-help/help-web) and desktop GIS plugins for [QGIS](software-help/help-qgis) and Esri's [ArcGIS](software-help/help-arc). They simplify the process of adding riverscape-related data to your preferred GIS platform, ensuring meaningful layer organization and symbology. We offer three versions of the **Riverscapes Viewer** to meet your specific needs.

The **Viewers** are designed to work with [riverscapes projects](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/), which contain specific collections of data related to riverscapes. You can discover _riverscape projects_ from the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net). You open any _riverscapes project_ in the Viewer and a project explorer exposes curated project contents.

Most _riverscpae project_ types include primarily GIS data, displayed with meaningful names and icons and the curated symbology. However, the viewer also exposes non-GIS data, like reports, json, tabular data, xml, imagery, PDFs, databases and more. Clicking on a geopspatial layer adds it to the current map in a carefulluy designed order with predefined symbology tailored to the layer in question.
