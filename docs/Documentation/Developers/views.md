RAVE allows projects to come pre loaded with project views. If present, these will allow adding to map a specific combination of layer files to the map.

This page needs to be spelt out. For now see [this issue](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RaveAddIn/issues/45) and [this example](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RiverscapesXML/blob/master/RaveBusinessLogic/VBET.xml#L117-L125) of how they are specified in [business logic](http://rave.riverscapes.xyz/business-logic.html	).
