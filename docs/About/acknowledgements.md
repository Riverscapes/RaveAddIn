<a href="http://riverscapes.xyz"><img class="float-left" src="https://rave.riverscapes.xyz/assets/images/logos/RC_Black.png"></a> RAVE is brought to you for free by the [Riverscapes Consortium](http://riverscapes.xyz). It is how you visualize and explore _any_  [Riverscapes Projects](https://riverscapes.xyz/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/) found in the [Riverscapes Warehouse](https://riverscapes.xyz/Data_Warehouses/).




## Developers
<a href="https://northarrowresearch.com/"><img class="float-right" src="https://rave.riverscapes.xyz/assets/images/logos/NAR.png"></a> [North Arrow Research](https://northarrowresearch.com/) developed the RAVE suite of tools.


For a complete list of developers and their contributions, see Github [ArcRAVE](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RaveAddIn/graphs/contributors) and [QRAVE](https://github.com/Riverscapes/QRAVEPlugin/graphs/contributors) <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> repositories.

## Project Curators
Part of what makes RAVE useful is the symbology that is baked into when you add layers from a [Riverscapes Project](https://riverscapes.xyz/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/) to the map. The [Riverscapes Project Curators Team](github.com/orgs/Riverscapes/teams/riverscape-project-curators/members) based largely in the [Utah State University Ecogeomorphology and Topographic Analysis Lab](http://etal.joewheaton.org):

## Funding

RAVE development has been funded primarily by the [Bureau of Land Management](https://www.blm.gov/montana-dakotas) and [Anabranch Solutions](http://anabranchsolutions.com). BLM has supproted the development of ArcRAVE & WebRAVE. This support has been through co-operative agreements between BLM and Utah State University, with subawards to North Arrow Research.

[Anabranch Solutions](http://anabranchsolutions.com) funded the development of QRAVE, so that a completely free, open-source GIS alternative to access RAVE from within [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) was accessible to those without access to ESRI's ArcGIS.
