## Background

RAVE is part of the [Riverscapes Consortium's](http://riverscapes.xyz) much larger family of [tools](https://riverscapes.xyz/Tools/) for analyzing riverscapes. RAVE itself does not do any analysis, but allows exploring of any [Riverscapes-compliant project](https://riverscapes.github.io/riverscapes-website/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/). RAVE provides an explorer in which you can navigate the "project tree", and add any layer to map symbolized appropriately. 

One of the real advantages of having [riverscapes projects](https://riverscapes.xyz/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/), is the ability to share that data with GIS users for them to explore in GIS. There are multiple ways to use RAVE: the QGIS Plug-In, the ArcGIS Add-in, or through WebRAVE. We take a test-drive of RAVE in this < five minute video:
