## Background

RAVE is part of the [Riverscapes Consortium's](http://riverscapes.net) much larger family of [tools](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/) for analyzing riverscapes. RAVE itself does not do any analysis, but allows exploring of any [Riverscapes-compliant project](https://riverscapes.github.io/riverscapes-website/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/). RAVE is a geospatial data explorer in which you can navigate the "project tree" of GIS data within a project, and add layers to map symbolized appropriately.

RAVE also provides access to free web mapping services such as aerial imagery, topographic maps. These "base maps" can be added to your current map document for additional context.

One of the real advantages of having [riverscapes projects](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/), is the ability to share that data with others and for everyone to see the same data symbolized the same way.
