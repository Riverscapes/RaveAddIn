The Riverscapes Viewer is one of several [applications](https://www.riverscapes.net/page/apps) that the [Riverscapes Consortium](http://riverscapes.net) has developed for unlocking riverscapes data. The Viewer itself does not do any analysis, but allows exploring of any riverscapes project, including those downloaded from the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net). It is a geospatial data explorer in which you can navigate the GIS data within a project, adding layers to map symbolized appropriately.

The following video provides a brief overview.
