## Updating

At any time after it is installed, you can return to the QGIS plugins manager and update the plugin by clicking the `Update` button next to the `Riverscapes Viewer` plugin.

## Minimum Requirements

The Riverscapes Viewer for [QGIS](https://qgis.org) requires QGIS 3.16 or newer. We strongly recommend using the QGIS Long Term Release that is currently 3.40.

:::warning
**MacOS Users:** There are currently no builds available for QGIS LTR 3.40 on macOS. If you're using a Mac, please install [this version of QGIS 3.42.1 instead](https://www.qgis.org/downloads/macos/pr/qgis_pr_final-3_42_1_20250324_153321.dmg). Windows and Linux users are unaffected and should proceed with installing QGIS LTR 3.40 as usual.

## Updating Resources

By default, the Riverscapes Viewer automatically synchronizes (downloads) the latest [symbology](/technical-reference/symbology) and [business logic](/technical-reference/business-logic) from [RiverscapesXML repo](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RiverscapesXML) to your local resource folder. You can also force an update at any time. To do this, from the Riverscapes Viewer toolbar choose  `Tools → Update resources`.

You can browse to that resource folder from the toolbar by choosing `Tools → Open Resources folder`.

## QGIS - Need to get GIS?

If you do not have [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) already, or even if you have never used GIS, we show you below how quickly you can get up and running with the free desktop QGIS software (on Windows, Mac or Linux) and get the Riverscapes Viewer installed and start looking at a [Riverscapes Project](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/) from the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net/).

**Installation time**: less than 5 minutes
