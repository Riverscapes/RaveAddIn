## Minimum Requirements

The Riverscapes Viewer for QGIS requires QGIS 3.16 or newer.

## Updating Resources

You will want to update resources just about every time you use the Viewer (including on a new install) to make sure you have the latest [symbology](/technical-reference/symbology) and [business logic](/technical-reference/business-logic). To do this, you simply go to the Viewer toolbar and choose `Help → Update Resources`. This then downloads the latest files from the [RiverscapesXML repo](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RiverscapesXML) and places them in a local resource folder. You can browse to that resource folder from the toolbar by choosing `Help → Find Resources Folder`.

If you do not have [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) already, or even if you have never used GIS, we show you below how quickly you can get up and running with the free desktop QGIS software (on Windows, Mac or Linux) and get the Riverscapes Viewer installed and start looking at a [Riverscapes Project](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/) from the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net/).
