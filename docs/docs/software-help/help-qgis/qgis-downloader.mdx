With the Riverscapes Viewer for QGIS you can download riverscapes projects from the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net). This feature (new in version 1.1) allows you to browse the Data Exchange, select a project, and download it directly to your local computer workspace.

:::tip
Downloading projects via the Viewer is the easiest way to get started with Riverscapes data in QGIS. It automatically handles the folder structure and prepares the project for viewing.

## Before You Begin

1. **Riverscapes Account:** You must be logged in to access and download projects. Visit the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net) and create an account first if you don't have one already. See also [help on creating an account](https://docs.riverscapes.net/products/data-exchange/help/signup) on our documentation site.
2. **Local Storage:** Ensure you have enough disk space for the project you are downloading. 

## Getting Started

To open the download dialog:

1. Click the **Download Project** button in the Riverscapes toolbar.
2. Or right-click in the project explorer pane and choose `Download Project from Data Exchange`.

## Step 1: Project Selection

Find a project on the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net) and copy either its **Project ID (UUID)** or the **URL** of the project page. (See [remote projects](qgis-remote-projects##find-and-identify-the-data-exchange-project) for ways to copy the Project ID.)

1. Paste the ID or URL into the input box.
2. Click **Verify Project**.
3. Once verified, you will see the project details, including the name, owner, and total number of files.

Click `Next` to proceed.

## Step 2: Location Selection

Choose where on your computer the project should be saved.

1. **Parent Folder:** Select the directory where you want the project folder to be created.
2. **Folder Name:** This defaults to the project name but can be customized.

Click `Next` to proceed to file selection.

## Step 3: File Selection

In this step, you can choose exactly which files you want to download. You don't always need everything! Each file will have one of the following *Status* values:

- **New:** Files that don't exist locally yet.
- **Up to date:** Files that already exist locally and match the version on the Data Exchange (these are locked by default).
- **Update available:** Files that exist locally but have a newer version available online.
- **Mandatory:** The `project.rs.xml` file is always required and selected by default.

Use the checkboxes to select the files you need. Click `Download` to begin.

## Step 4: Download Status

The final step shows the progress of the download.

1. **Overall Progress:** Shows the total percentage and data transferred.
2. **File Progress:** Shows which specific file is currently being downloaded.
3. **Completion:** Once complete, the project will be automatically added to your Riverscapes Viewer project explorer.

## Notes

- If you are updating an existing project, the downloader will only download the files that have changed, saving time and bandwidth.
- You can cancel the download at any time, but the project may be in an incomplete state until the download is resumed and finished.
