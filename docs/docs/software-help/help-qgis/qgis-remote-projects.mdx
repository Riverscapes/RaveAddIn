## Requirements

You will need:

1. A Riverscapes account. Visit the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net) and create one first if you don't have one already. See also [help on creating an account](https://docs.riverscapes.net/products/data-exchange/help/signup) on our documentation site.
2. A reasonably good internet connection for streaming layers. 

## Usage

### Find and identify the Data Exchange project you want view

The first step in viewing a remote project in QGIS to Get the project ID. Unless it was sent to you, the easiest way to do that is to browse the Riverscapes Data Exchange at [data.riverscapes.net](https://data.riverscapes.net) and use the powerful search features. Once you find the project, you can get the Project ID in many ways:

* on a project page, you can copy the URL
* on a project page, there is a widget in top right corner to copy the project to clipboard, shown below. Choose `Copy project ID`.
* on a project page, in the overview tab, the PROJECT ID is displayed, and there is a copy to clipboard button next to it
* in project 'cards' shown in search results, the kebob menu has a Copy Project ID to clipboard option
* in project table view, there is a copy project to clipboard button

If you have the project downloaded and loaded into the riverscapes viewer, you can also get the project ID from the riverscapes metadata panel under 'Warehouse Meta', `id`. Right click on it and choose 'Copy value'.

### Load a remote project

* From the Riverscapes Viewer toolbar button, choose Open Remote Project as shown.
![menu](/images/qviewer/qviewer_menu_remote_project_highlighted_v1.1.1_windows.min.png)
* Paste the Project id in the dialog. 
* A browser window will open to authenticate your account (only once per QGIS session).
* The project will appear in the Riverscapes Viewer Pane, and the default view will open in the map.
