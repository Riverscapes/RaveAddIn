Welcome to the Riverscapes Analysis Visualization Explorer (RAVE) software website. Here you can find general information about the RAVE software, including information on [opening projects](open-project.html), [symbolizing layers](symbology.html) and controlling how projects are displayed using [business logic XML](business-logic.html).

## Background

RAVE AddIn is part of the [Riverscapes Consortium's](http://riverscapes.xyz) much larger family of tools for analyzing riverscapes. RAVE itself does not do any analysis, but allows exploring of any [Riverscapes-compliant project](https://riverscapes.github.io/riverscapes-website/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/). Rave provides an explorer in which you can navigate the "project tree", and add any layer to map symbolized appropriately. 

One of the real advantages of having [riverscapes projects](https://riverscapes.xyz/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/), is the ability to share that data with GIS users for them to explore in GIS. We do this with a simple Add-In to GIS called [RAVE](http://rave.riverscapes.xyz/). We take a test-drive of RAVE in this < five minute video:
