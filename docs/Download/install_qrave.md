## Minimum Requirements

QRAVE requires QGIS 3.16 or newer.

## Updating Resources

<img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/updateresources.png"> You will want to update resources just about every time you use RAVE (including on a new install) to make sure you have the latest symbology and business logic. To do this, you simply go to the QRAVE toolbar and choose `Help → Update Resources`. This then downloads the latest files from the [RiverscapesXML repo](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RiverscapesXML) and places them in a local resource folder. You can browse to that resource folder from the QRAVE toolbar by choosing `Help → Find Resources Folder`.

## QGIS - Need to get GIS?

If you do not have [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) already, or even if you have never used GIS, we show you below how quickly you can get up and running with the free desktop QGIS software (on Windows, Mac or Linux) and get QRAVE installed and start looking at a [Riverscapes Project](https://riverscapes.xyz/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/) from the [Riverscapes Warehouse](https://data.riverscapes.xyz/).

**Installation time**: < 5 minutes
